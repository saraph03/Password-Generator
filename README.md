# Password-Generator (Python)
Creating a random password-generating code in Python. 
Using the api.py file, you can run Flask and get a local host link in which you write /generate-password after the link to work the code. 
For Example, this would be written in your search bar: http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-password
After this, you would need to enter a digit used as the password length in the terminal of wherever you are running the code from. 
It should then display your desired password. 

Rules:
- You can choose the length of character starting from 8
- 2 uppercase letters from A to Z
- 2 lowercase letters from a to z
- 2 digits from 0 to 9
- 2 special characters such as !, ?, #, "
